# picochat

> HyperPub toolkit

The idea of bar where anyone regardless of belief or background is welcome.
- tricky huh?

## Start

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

## Using as a dependency

```bash
$ npm install picochat
```

```js
import Kernel from 'picochat'
const k = new Kernel(leveldb)
await k.load()

// --or-- in future releases
import { kernel, useProfile, usePeers, useChat } from 'picochat/react-hooks'
```

Proper docs will emerge when the time requires it.
For now read the `blockend/`-source or just [ask](https://github.com/telamon/picochat/issues).

If you're reading this it means that the docs are missing or in a bad state.

Writing and maintaining friendly and useful documentation takes
effort and time. In order to do faster releases
I will from now on provide documentation relational to project activity.
